Summary:
========
This document gives a rough estimation on the total number of triples we possibly produce from the Eurostat data sets.


Observation Stats:
==================

Total number of observations =  879,236,193

How did we calculate ?
Calculated by summing up the values of the datasets exists in the table of contents [1] published by EuroStat. 

Threats to validity 
The datasets are classified into different categories and hence there are cases where a dataset is listed twice in the table of contents but in different categories. The current observation stats computed without filtering the duplicity of datasets. Forexample, a dataset having title "ICT patent applications to the EPO by priority year at the regional level" and codename "pat_ep_rict" falls into 
two categories in the table of contents:
	European patent applications to EPO
	Patent applications to the EPO by priority year at the regional level



Triple Stats:
=============

Total estimation of triples varies between 5~8 billions

Forxample, lets we have an observation :

<data:Series FREQ="Q" indic="BS-OTEB" unit="BAL" s_adj="NSA" geo="AT" TIME_FORMAT="P3M">
  <data:Obs TIME_PERIOD="1996-Q1" OBS_VALUE="4.1" /> 
</data:Series>

Potential RDFication yields into :

<qb:Observation>
	<qb:dataset rdf:resource="/id/bsbu_q_bc#ds"/>
	<indic rdf:resource="/dic/indic#BS-OTEB"/>
	<s_adj rdf:resource="/dic/s_adj#NSA"/>
	<unit rdf:resource="/dic/unit#BAL"/>
	<geo rdf:resource="/dic/geo#AT"/>
	<dcterms:date>1996-03-31</dcterms:date>
	<sdmx-measure:obsValue>4.1</sdmx-measure:obsValue>
</qb:Observation>


BUT if an observation has less number of dimensions like:

<data:Series FREQ="A" unit="PC_EU27_PPS_HAB" geo="AT">
  <data:Obs TIME_PERIOD="1995" OBS_VALUE="135" /> 
</data:Series>

Potential RDFication yields into:

<qb:Observation>
	<qb:dataset rdf:resource="/id/tsieb010#ds"/>
	<unit rdf:resource="/dic/unit#PC_EU27_PPS_HAB"/>
	<geo rdf:resource="/dic/geo#AT"/>
	<dcterms:date>2006</dcterms:date>
	<sdmx-measure:obsValue>135</sdmx-measure:obsValue>
</qb:Observation>


So, the triples for each observation may vary depending on the number of dimensions used in that particular observation:

Taking 6 as a minimum number of triples per observation yields to : ~5.2 billion triples
Taking 10 as a minimum number of triples per observation yields to : ~8.8 billions triples


NOTE:

There will be triples generated from the DSD (Data Structure Definition) of the Eurostat datasets which is not taken into consideration in the current estimation of triples.
